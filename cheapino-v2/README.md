# Cheapino v2

This keymap will work with beta version of cheapino v2. The current layout is just a layer of QWERTY for testing.

## Known Issue

1. Rotary currently doesn't work as intended.
   It only works when you move it slowly and keep it in between 2 bumps. This happens because the encoder is treated as a button. Where in real life it produces "pulses" every few degrees or so. Thus it needs to be checked that way.

   Also there's no support for encoder in a matrix on PRK [see issue](https://github.com/picoruby/prk_firmware/issues/174)
